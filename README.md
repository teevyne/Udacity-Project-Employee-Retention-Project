# PROJECT 1: Predicting Employee Attriton
The project is to help a company which is trying to control attrition. The data used for this project is obtained from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). Following attributes are available for every employee.

1. Education
2. EnvironmentSatisfaction
3. JobInvolvement
4. JobSatisfaction
5. PerformanceRating
5. RelationshipSatisfaction
6. WorkLifeBalance

Therefore I am going to answer the following questions:
1. What is the effect of Income on attrition?
2. Which set of people are most likey to quit their job?
3. What is the impact of Age on Employee Attrition?

## Requirements
The project should run with libraries included in the Anaconda distribution. Following main libraries have been used:

1. Python 3.8.2
2. numpy 1.13.3
3. pandas 0.25.3
4. seaborn 0.10.0
5. matplotlib 0.8.4

## Files in the Repository
1. Employee Attrition.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis of the project
2. HR-Data.csv: Dataset used in the project
